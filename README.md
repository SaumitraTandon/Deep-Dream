# Computer Vision Masterclass: Deep Dream

Welcome to the Deep Dream project, part of the Computer Vision Masterclass series. This project demonstrates the implementation of the Deep Dream algorithm using TensorFlow.

## Overview

Deep Dream is a computer vision algorithm that uses a neural network to enhance patterns in images, creating dream-like, surreal visuals. This implementation is adapted from the [TensorFlow Deep Dream tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/generative/deepdream).

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to set up your environment with the necessary dependencies. Follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/deep-dream.git
    cd deep-dream
    ```

2. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Project

Open the `Deep dream.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook. You can start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
Navigate to the notebook file and run the cells in order. The notebook will guide you through the steps to implement and visualize the Deep Dream algorithm.

## Project Files

- `Deep dream.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Deep Dream implementation.
- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the dependencies needed to run the notebook.
- `README.md`: This readme file.
